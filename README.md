A batteries-included database for Dart & Flutter based on [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com).

---

## Features
- üîé Typo tolerant full-text search *with no extra configuration needed*
- üî• Blazingly fast search and reads (written in Rust)
- ü§ù Flutter friendly with a super easy-to-use API (see demo below!)
- üî± Powerful, declarative, and reactive queries
- üîå Cross-platform support ([web hopefully coming soon!](https://github.com/GregoryConrad/mimir/issues/10))

## Getting Started
- With Flutter, run `flutter pub add flutter_mimir`
- For Dart-only, run `dart pub add mimir`

Also read the [caveats below](#important-caveats).

## Demo
With Flutter, you can get started with as little as:
```dart
// Get an "index" to store our movies
final instance = await Mimir.defaultInstance;
final index = instance.getIndex('movies');

// Add movies to our index
await index.addDocuments(myMovies);

// Perform a search!
final results = await index.search(query: 'jarrassic par'); // returns Jurassic Park!
```

## Reference Documentation
A collection of commonly used APIs ready for copy-paste into your application.

#### Getting & Creating an Index
```dart
// With Flutter (flutter_mimir)
final instance = await Mimir.defaultInstance;

// Dart-only (just mimir)
final instance = Mimir.getInstance(
  path: instanceDirectory,
  // Following line will change based on your platform
  library: DynamicLibrary.open('libembedded_milli.so'),
); 

// Get an index (creates one lazily if not already created)
final moviesIndex = instance.getIndex('movies');
```

#### Configuring an Index
```dart
final currSettings = await index.getSettings();
await index.setSettings(currSettings.copyWith(
  // Fields in the document that are included in full-text search.
  // Use null, the default, to search all fields
  searchableFields: <String>[],
  // Fields in the document that can be queried/filtered by.
  // You probably don't need to change this; it is automatically
  // updated for you.
  filterableFields: <String>[],
  // Fields in the document that can be sorted by in searches/queries.
  sortableFields: <String>[],
  // The ranking rules of this index, see:
  // https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/settings.html#ranking-rules
  rankingRules: <String>[],
  // The stop words of this index, see:
  // https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/settings.html#stop-words
  stopWords: <String>[],
  // A list of synonyms to link words with the same meaning together.
  // Note: in most cases, you probably want to add synonyms both ways, like below:
  synonyms: <Synonyms>[
    Synonyms(
      word: 'automobile',
      synonyms: ['vehicle'],
    ),
    Synonyms(
      word: 'vehicle',
      synonyms: ['automobile'],
    ),
  ],
  // Whether to enable typo tolerance in searches.
  typosEnabled: true,
  // The minimum size of a word that can have 1 typo.
  // See minWordSizeForTypos.oneTypo here:
  // https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/settings.html#typo-tolerance-object
  minWordSizeForOneTypo: 5,
  // The minimum size of a word that can have 2 typos.
  // See minWordSizeForTypos.twoTypos here:
  // https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/settings.html#typo-tolerance-object
  minWordSizeForTwoTypos: 9,
  // Words that disallow typos. See disableOnWords here:
  // https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/settings.html#typo-tolerance-object
  disallowTyposOnWords: <String>[],
  // Fields that disallow typos. See disableOnAttributes here:
  // https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/settings.html#typo-tolerance-object
  disallowTyposOnFields: <String>[],
));
```

#### Manipulating Documents
```dart
// Adding documents (replaces any documents with the same id)
await index.addDocument(document);
await index.addDocuments(documents);

// Replacing all documents
await index.setDocuments(documents);

// Deleting documents
await index.deleteDocument(id);
await index.deleteDocuments(ids);
await index.deleteAllDocuments();

// Getting documents (not querying--see next section!)
final docOrNull = await index.getDocument(someId);
final allDocs = await index.getAllDocuments();
final allDocsStream = index.documents;
```

#### Searching/Querying
```dart
// Getting a stream of results (very useful in Flutter!)
// Same arguments as index.search; see below
final documentsStream = index.searchStream(...);

// Performing a search/query (using movies here)!
final movies = moviesIndex.search(
  // The string to use for full-text search. Can be user-supplied.
  // To do a regular database query without full-text search, leave this null.
  query: 'some wordz with typoes to saerch for',
  // The filter used to filter results in a full-text search or query.
  // See the next section; this is a very handy feature in mimir.
  // Set to null to not filter out any documents.
  filter: Mimir.where('director', isEqualTo: 'Alfred Hitchcock'),
  // The fields to sort by (in ascending or descending order).
  // Can be left as null to sort by relevance (to the query text)!
  sortBy: [
    // Sort by year, newest to oldest
    SortBy.desc('year'),
    // In case 2+ documents share the same year, sort by increasing profit next
    SortBy.asc('profit'),
  ],
  // If you want to limit the number of results you get, use the resultsLimit.
  // Defaults to null, which means return all matches.
  resultsLimit: null,
  // Defaults to null, see https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/search.html#matching-strategy
  matchingStrategy: null,
);
```

#### Filtering Search/Query Results
There is a "raw" filtering API in mimir provided by `Filter`,
but it is recommended to use this API that creates `Filter`s for you instead.

Here are the methods you need to be aware of:
- `Mimir.or(subFilters)` creates an "or" filter (like `||`) of the sub-filters
- `Mimir.and(subFilters)` creates an "and" filter (like `&&`) of the sub-filters
- `Mimir.not(subFilter)` creates a "not" filter (like `!someCondition`) of the sub-filter
- `Mimir.where(condition)` creates a single filter from a given condition.
- The above can be composed together to create powerful, declarative queries!

Heres an example that shows these methods in practice.

Say our Dart boolean logic is (formatted to show intent):
```dart
(
    (
        (movie['fruit'] == 'apple')
        &&
        (movie['year'] >= 2000 && movie['year'] <= 2009)
    )
    ||
    movie['colors'].any((color) => {'red', 'green'}.contains(color))
)
```

Then our "raw" filter API logic would be:
```dart
final filter = Filter.or([
  Filter.and([
    Filter.equal(field: 'fruit', value: 'apple'),
    Filter.between(field: 'year', from: '2000', to: '2009'),
  ]),
  Filter.inValues(field: 'colors', values: ['red', 'green']),
])
```
Which is somewhat hard to read.

Here's what the recommended approach would look like:
```dart
final filter = Mimir.or([
  Mimir.and([
    Mimir.where('fruit', isEqualTo: 'apple'),
    Mimir.where('year', isBetween: '2000', and: '2009'),
  ]),
  Mimir.where('colors', containsAtLeastOneOf: ['red', 'green']),
])
```
I think most would agree that this is the easiest of the three to understand,
as it almost reads as pure English, even for complex conditions.

## Important Caveats
Please read this caveats _before_ adding mimir to your project.

- Right now, mimir is in alpha status _and should not be used in production_!
  - Major APIs are somewhat solidified; however, internal workings are _incomplete_
  - [The biggest blocker from being production ready right now](https://github.com/GregoryConrad/mimir/issues/9)
  - After I take care of this issue, and a few others, mimir _should_ be production ready
- Document `id`s
  - Documents without an `id` field will have one autogenerated (out of necessity)
    - I would recommend adding an `id` field to your documents when possible though
  - Current bug in milli: you need your `id` field at _the top_ of your documents
    - See https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions/206 for more
- Indexing speed
  - At the moment, indexing a very large amount of data at once can be slow-ish
    - See https://github.com/GregoryConrad/mimir/issues/59
  - Prefer `addDocuments` over `addDocument` when possible
    - `addDocuments` handles the documents with a batch, which is faster
  - Calling `setSettings` causes reindexing in _almost all_ cases
    - Avoid calling `setSettings` after documents are already added when possible
    - See https://github.com/GregoryConrad/mimir/issues/50
  - Reads/searches/queries will always be extremely fast!
- Resource usage
  - Note: most modern devices run mimir just fine; however:
  - Milli, a core component of Meilisearch, is what gives mimir a lot of its power
  - Unfortunately, Milli is somewhat resource intensive, making mimir itself somewhat heavy-weight
  - Several thousand detailed documents can easily consume several MB of disk space & RAM
  - If you do not need all the features provided by mimir, also consider an alternative!
    - [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) for simple key-value storage
    - [Isar](https://pub.dev/packages/isar) for more sophisticated use-cases
    - If you need easy, typo-tolerant full-text search, you will want mimir
      - I am unaware of any other databases that currently provide typo-tolerant full-text search in Flutter
        - Why I made mimir in the first place!
        - Note: Isar does have full-text search, but it is _not_ typo tolerant
