A batteries-included database for Dart & Flutter based on [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com).

---

## Features
- üîé Typo tolerant full-text search *with no extra configuration needed*
- üî• Blazingly fast search and reads (written in Rust)
- ü§ù Flutter friendly with a super easy-to-use API (see demo below!)
- üî± Powerful, declarative, and reactive queries
- üîå Cross-platform support ([web hopefully coming soon!](https://github.com/GregoryConrad/mimir/issues/10))

## Getting Started
- With Flutter, run `flutter pub add flutter_mimir`
- For Dart-only, run `dart pub add mimir`

## Demo
With Flutter, you can get started with as little as:
```dart
// Get an "index" to store our movies
final instance = await Mimir.defaultInstance;
final index = instance.getIndex('movies');

// Add movies to our index
await index.addDocuments(myMovies);

// Perform a search!
final results = await index.search(query: 'jarrassic par'); // returns Jurassic Park!
```

## Reference Documentation
A collection of commonly used APIs ready for copy-paste into your application.

#### Getting & Creating an Index
```dart
// With Flutter (flutter_mimir)
final instance = await Mimir.defaultInstance;

// Dart-only (just mimir)
final instance = Mimir.getInstance(
  path: instanceDirectory,
  // Following line will change based on your platform
  library: DynamicLibrary.open('libembedded_milli.so'),
); 

// Get an index (creates one lazily if not already created)
final moviesIndex = instance.getIndex('movies');
```

#### Configuring an Index
```dart
final currSettings = await index.getSettings();
await index.setSettings(currSettings.copyWith(
  // Fields in the document that are included in full-text search.
  // Use null, the default, to search all fields
  searchableFields: <String>[],
  // Fields in the document that can be queried/filtered by.
  // You probably don't need to change this; it is automatically
  // updated for you.
  filterableFields: <String>[],
  // Fields in the document that can be sorted by in searches/queries.
  sortableFields: <String>[],
  // The ranking rules of this index, see:
  // https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/settings.html#ranking-rules
  rankingRules: <String>[],
  // The stop words of this index, see:
  // https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/settings.html#stop-words
  stopWords: <String>[],
  // A list of synonyms to link words with the same meaning together.
  // Note: in most cases, you probably want to add synonyms both ways, like below:
  synonyms: <Synonyms>[
    Synonym(
      word: 'automobile',
      synonyms: ['vehicle'],
    ),
    Synonym(
      word: 'vehicle',
      synonyms: ['automobile'],
    ),
  ],
  // Whether to enable typo tolerance in searches.
  typosEnabled: true,
  // The minimum size of a word that can have 1 typo.
  // See minWordSizeForTypos.oneTypo here:
  // https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/settings.html#typo-tolerance-object
  minWordSizeForOneTypo: 5,
  // The minimum size of a word that can have 2 typos.
  // See minWordSizeForTypos.twoTypos here:
  // https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/settings.html#typo-tolerance-object
  minWordSizeForTwoTypos: 9,
  // Words that disallow typos. See disableOnWords here:
  // https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/settings.html#typo-tolerance-object
  disallowTyposOnWords: <String>[],
  // Fields that disallow typos. See disableOnAttributes here:
  // https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/settings.html#typo-tolerance-object
  disallowTyposOnFields: <String>[],
));
```

#### Manipulating Documents
```dart
// Adding documents (replaces any documents with the same id)
await index.addDocument(document);
await index.addDocuments(documents);

// Replacing all documents
await index.setDocuments(documents);

// Deleting documents
await index.deleteDocument(id);
await index.deleteDocuments(ids);
await index.deleteAllDocuments();

// Getting documents (not querying--see next section!)
final docOrNull = await index.getDocument(someId);
final allDocs = await index.getAllDocuments();
final allDocsStream = index.documents;
```

#### Searching/Querying
```dart

// TODO filter API
```

## Important Caveats
Please read this caveats _before_ adding mimir to your project.

- Right now, mimir is in alpha status _and should not be used in production_!
  - Major APIs are somewhat solidified; however, internal workings are _incomplete_
  - [The biggest blocker from being production ready right now](https://github.com/GregoryConrad/mimir/issues/9)
  - After I take care of this issue, and a few others, mimir _should_ be production ready
- Document `id`s
  - Documents without an `id` field will have one autogenerated (out of necessity)
    - I would recommend adding an `id` field to your documents when possible though
  - Current bug in milli: you need your `id` field at _the top_ of your documents
    - See https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions/206 for more
- Indexing speed
  - At the moment, indexing a very large amount of data at once can be slow-ish
    - See https://github.com/GregoryConrad/mimir/issues/59
  - Prefer `addDocuments` over `addDocument` when possible
    - `addDocuments` handles the documents with a batch, which is faster
  - Calling `setSettings` causes reindexing in _almost all_ cases
    - Avoid calling `setSettings` after documents are already added when possible
    - See https://github.com/GregoryConrad/mimir/issues/50
  - Reads/searches/queries will always be extremely fast!
- Resource usage
  - Note: most modern devices run mimir just fine; however:
  - Milli, a core component of Meilisearch, is what gives mimir a lot of its power
  - Unfortunately, Milli is somewhat resource intensive, making mimir itself somewhat heavy-weight
  - Several thousand detailed documents can easily consume several MB of disk space & RAM
  - If you do not need all the features provided by mimir, also consider an alternative!
    - [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) for simple key-value storage
    - [Isar](https://pub.dev/packages/isar) for more sophisticated use-cases
    - If you need easy, typo-tolerant full-text search, you will want mimir
      - I am unaware of any other databases that currently provide typo-tolerant full-text search in Flutter
        - Why I made mimir in the first place!
        - Note: Isar does have full-text search, but it is _not_ typo tolerant
